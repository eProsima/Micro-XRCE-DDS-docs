Micro RTPS Gen
==============

*Micro RTPS Gen* is a Java application used to generate source code for the *eProsima Micro RTPS* software.

This tool is able to generate from a given IDL specification file, the C struct associated with the
Topic, as well as, the serialization and deserialization methods.
Also, it has the possibility of generate a sample demo that works with proposed topic.
As an example of the powerful of this tool, the following shows the source code generated from the ShapeDemo IDL file.

::

    // ShapeType.idl

    struct ShapeType {
        @key string color;
        long x;
        long y;
        long shapesize;
    };

If we will perform the following command: ::

   $ micrortpsgen ShapeType.idl

it will generate the following header file and its corresponding source:

.. code-block:: C

    /*!
     * @file ShapeType.h
     * This header file contains the declaration of the described types in the IDL file.
     *
     * This file was generated by the tool gen.
     */

    #ifndef _ShapeType_H_
    #define _ShapeType_H_

    #include <stdint.h>
    #include <stdbool.h>

    /*!
     * @brief This struct represents the structure ShapeType defined by the user in the IDL file.
     * @ingroup SHAPETYPE
     */
    typedef struct ShapeType
    {
        char color[255];
        int32_t x;
        int32_t y;
        int32_t shapesize;

    } ShapeType;

    struct MicroBuffer;

    bool ShapeType_serialize_topic(struct MicroBuffer* writer, const ShapeType* topic);
    bool ShapeType_deserialize_topic(struct MicroBuffer* reader, ShapeType* topic);
    uint32_t ShapeType_size_of_topic(const ShapeType* topic, uint32_t size);

    #endif // _ShapeType_H_


*Micro RTPS Gen* is also able to generate both *publisher* and *subscriber* source code examples related with the topic speficified in the IDL file adding the flag ``-example``: ::

    $ micrortpsgen -example <file.idl>


In order to use these examples, the client library must be compiled with the ``WRITE_ACCESS_PROFILE`` option for the *publisher*
and the ``READ_ACCESS_PROFILE`` option for the *subscriber*.

Installation
------------

For use *Micro RTPS Gen* you have to follow the next steps:

1. Install its dependencies:

    1.1 `Gradle <https://gradle.org/install/>`_.

    1.2 `Java JDK <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_.

2. Clone the code from the GitHub repository. ::

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/eProsima/micro-RTPS-gen.git
    $ cd micro-RTPS-gen

3. Build the code with Gradle. ::

    $ gradle build

Notes
-----

At the present time, *Micro RTPS Gen* only supports Structs composed of integer, string, array and sequence types
even though it is planned to enhance the capabilities of the *Micro RTPS Gen* tool in a near future.
