Client API
==========

*eProsima Micro XRCE-DDS* provides the user with a C API to create *eProsima Micro XRCE-DDS Clients* applications.
**All** functions needed to set up the *Client* can be found in the :code:`client.h` header.
That is the only header the user needs to include.

In this section, we provide the full API for the *Micro XRCE-DDS Client*.
As a nomenclature, this API uses the :code:`uxr_` prefix in all of its public functions and the :code:`uxr`
prefix in the types. In constants values, the :code:`UXR_` prefix is used.
The functions belonging to the public interface of the library are only those with the tag :code:`UXRDDLAPI`
in their declarations.

The functions are grouped as follows:

* :ref:`session_api`
* :ref:`entities_xml_api`
* :ref:`entities_ref_api`
* :ref:`entities_bin_api`
* :ref:`entities_common_api`
* :ref:`read_access_api`
* :ref:`write_access_api`
* :ref:`discovery_api`
* :ref:`topic_serialization_api`
* :ref:`general_utilities_api`
* :ref:`transport_api`

This function requests a *datareader* previously created on the *Agent* to perform a read operation
that fetches data from the middleware.
The returned value is an identifier of the request.
All received topics have the same request identifier.
The topics are received on the callback topic through the ``run_session`` function.
If there is no error with the request data, a status callback with the value ``UXR_STATUS_OK`` is generated along with
the topics retrieval.
If there is an error, a status error is sent by the *Agent*.
The message is written into the stream buffer.
To send the message, it is necessary to call either the ``uxr_flash_output_streams`` or the ``uxr_run_session`` function.

:session: Session structure previously initialized and created.
:stream_id: The output stream ID used to send messages to the *Agent*.
:datareader_id: The ID of the *datareader* that reads the topics from the middleware.

It does so by resetting the ``delivery_control`` parameters and the input stream ID used to receive the data.
The returned value is an identifier of the request.

This function requests a *datawriter*, *requester* or *replier* previously created on the *Agent* to perform a write operation
into a specific output stream.
It initializes a ``ucdrBuffer`` struct where a data of ``data_size`` size must be serialized.
If there is sufficient space for writing ``data_size`` bytes into the stream, the returned value is the XRCE request ID, otherwise it is ``0``.
The topic is sent in the following ``run_session`` function.
If ``UCLIENT_PROFILE_MULTITHREAD`` is enabled, user should unlock the stream lock after serializing the requested amount of data using
``UXR_UNLOCK_STREAM_ID(session, stream_id);``

.. note::
    All ``data_size`` bytes requested are sent to the *Agent* after a ``run_session`` call,
    no matter if the ``ucdrBuffer`` has been used or not.

:session: Session structure previously initialized and created.
:stream_id: The output stream ID where the messages are written.

This function requests a *datawriter*, *requester* or *replier* previously created on the *Agent* to allocate an output stream of ``data_size`` bytes
for a write operation.
This function initializes an ``ucdrBuffer`` struct where a topic of ``data_size`` size is serialized.
If there is sufficient space for writing ``data_size`` bytes into the stream, the returned value is the XRCE request ID, otherwise it is ``0``.
The topic is sent in the following ``run_session`` function. If, during the serialization process, the buffer gets overfilled, the
``flush_callback`` function is called and the user has to run a session for flushing the stream.
If ``UCLIENT_PROFILE_MULTITHREAD`` is enabled, user should unlock the stream lock after serializing the requested amount of data using
``UXR_UNLOCK_STREAM_ID(session, stream_id);``

:session: Session structure related to the buffer to be flushed.

.. _discovery_api:

Discovery profile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The discovery profile allows discovering *Agents* in the network by UDP.
The reachable *Agents* respond to the discovery call by sending information about themselves, as their IP and port.
There are two modes: unicast and multicast.
The discovery phase precedes the call to the ``uxr_create_session`` function, as it serves to determine the
*Agent* to connect with.
These functions are enabled when ``PROFILE_DISCOVERY`` is activated as a CMake argument.
The declaration of these functions can be found in ``uxr/client/profile/discovery/discovery.h``.

.. note::
    This feature is only available on Linux.

------

.. code-block:: c

    bool uxr_discovery_agents_default(uint32_t attempts, int period, uxrOnAgentFound on_agent_func, void* args);

(which is the default used by the *Agent*).

:attempts: The times a discovery message is sent across the network.
:period: The wait time between two successive discovery calls.
:on_agent_func: The callback function that is called when an *Agent* is discovered.
                It returns a boolean value. A ``true`` means that the discovery routine has finished.
                A ``false`` implies that the discovery routine must continue searching *Agents*.
:args: User arguments passed to the callback function.

The function signature for the ``on_agent_func`` callback is:

.. code-block:: c

    typedef bool (*uxrOnAgentFound) (const TransportLocator* locator, void* args);

:locator: Transport locator of a discovered agent.
:args: User pointer data.

------

.. code-block:: c

This function looks for *Agents* in the network using UDP/IP unicast,
using a list of unicast directions with the addresses and ports set by the user.

:attempts: The times a discovery message is sent across the network.
:period: The wait time between two successive discovery calls.
:on_agent_func: The callback function that is called when an *Agent* is discovered.
                It returns a boolean value. A ``true`` means that the discovery routine has finished.
                A ``false`` implies that the discovery routine must continue searching *Agents*.
:args: User arguments passed to the callback function.
:agent_list: The list of addresses used for discovering *Agents*.
:agent_list_size: The size of the ``agent_list``.

The function signature for the ``on_time_func`` callback is the same as above.

This function pings a *Micro XRCE-DDS Agent* to check if it is already up and running.

This method does not require an XRCE session to be established beforehand. It acts directly over
the transport layer so if a session is running simultaneouly, data can be loss.

It returns ``true`` if a response was received from the *Agent*, ``false`` otherwise.

:comm: A pointer to a properly initialized XRCE-DDS communication structure, used to send the ping request.
