Memory optimization
===================

Executable code size
--------------------
To manage the executable code size, the library can be compiled enabling or disabling several profiles.
To add or remove a profile from the library, edit the ``client.config`` file.
More information can be found at: :ref:`micro_xrce_dds_client_label`.

NOTE: If you are compiling your app with *gcc*, its highly recommended compile it with the linker flag: ``-Wl,--gc-sections``.
It will remove the code that your app does not use from the final executable.

Runtime size
------------
The *Client* is dynamic memory free and static memory free.
It implies that all memory footprint depends only on how the stack grows during the execution.
Some values can be modified to control the stack and impact to a large degree:

Stream buffers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Make sure you define only the streams that will be used.
   You can define a maximum `127` best-effort streams and `128` reliable streams,
   but for the majority of purposes, only one stream of either best effort or reliable can be used.

2. The history of a reliable stream is used for recovering from lost messages and speeding up the communication.
   For output streams, more history value will allow writing and sending more messages without waiting for confirmation.
   If a history of an output stream is full (no messages were still confirmed by the *Agent*), 
   no more messages can be stored in the stream.
   For input streams, the history is used for recovering faster when the messages are lost using less extra band-width.
   If your connection is highly reliable and to save memory is a priority, a reduced history can be used.

3. The *size* of the stream corresponds to the total reserved memory for the stream.
   This *size* must be according to the next value: ``MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE * HISTORY``.
   The ``MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`` value represents the maximum message size that can be sent without fragment the message.
   ``MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`` must be less or equal than the transport *MTU* used.

Transport MTUs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each transport has a different *MTU*.
The *MTU* value can be defined into the ``client.config`` file.
The *MTU* will represent the ``MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`` that can be sent or received.
The transport uses the *MTU* value to create an internal buffer, so this value will affect increasing transport struct size.
