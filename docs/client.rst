eProsima Micro XRCE-DDS Client
==============================
In *eProsima Micro XRCE-DDS*, a *Client* can communicate with DDS Network as any other DDS actor could do.
*Clients* can publish and subscribe to data Topics in the DDS Global Data Space.

*eProsima Micro XRCE-DDS* provides you with a C API to create *eProsima Micro XRCE-DDS Clients* application.
All functions needed to set up the *Client* can be found in ``client.h`` header.
That is the only header you need to include.

Profiles
--------

The *Client* library follows a profile concept that enables to choose, add or remove some features in configuration time.
That allows customizing the *Client* library size, if there are features that are not used.
The profiles can be chosen in ``client.config`` and start with the prefix ``PROFILE``.
As part of these profiles, you can choose between several transport layers.
Communication with the *Agent* is done through the transport you choose.

The implementation of the transport depends on the platform.
The next tables show the current implementation.

============ ========== ========= =========
Transport     Linux      Windows   NuttX
============ ========== ========= =========
UDP           X           X        X
TCP           X           X        X
Serial        X                    X
============ ========== ========= =========

The addition of a new transport or an existant transport for a new platform can be easily implemented setting the callbacks of a ``uxrCommunication`` structure.
See the current transport implementations as an example of new custom transport.

Configuration
-------------
There are several definitions for configuring and building of the *Client* library at **compile-time**.
These definitions allow you to create a version of the library according to your requirements.
These definitions can be modified at ``client.config`` file.
For incorporating the changes to your project, it is necessary to run the ``cmake`` command every time the definitions change.

``PROFILE_DISCOVERY=<bool>``
    Enables or disables the functions of the discovery feature (currently, only for Linux).

``PROFILE_UDP_TRANSPORT=<bool>``
    Enables or disables the possibility to connect with the *Agent* by UDP.

``PROFILE_TCP_TRANSPORT=<bool>``
    Enables or disables the possibility to connect with the *Agent* by TCP.

``PROFILE_SERIAL_TRANSPORT=<bool>``
    Enables or disables the possibility to connect with the *Agent* by Serial.

``CONFIG_MAX_OUTPUT_BEST_EFFORT_STREAMS=<number>``
    Configures the maximum output best-effort streams that a session could have.
    The calls to ``uxr_create_output_best_effort_stream`` function for a session must be less or equal that this value.

``CONFIG_MAX_OUTPUT_RELIABLE_STREAMS=<number>``
    Configures the maximum output reliable streams that a session could have.
    The calls to ``uxr_create_output_reliable_stream`` function for a session must be less or equal that this value.

``CONFIG_MAX_INPUT_BEST_EFFORT_STREAMS=<number>``
    Configures the maximum input best-effort streams that a session could have.
    The calls to ``uxr_create_input_best_effort_stream`` function for a session must be less or equal that this value.

``CONFIG_MAX_INPUT_RELIABLE_STREAMS=<number>``
    Configures the maximum input reliable streams that a session could have.
    The calls to ``uxr_create_input_reliable_stream`` function for a session must be less or equal that this value.

``CONFIG_MAX_SESSION_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS=<number>``
    This value indicates the number of attempts that ``create_session`` and ``delete_session`` will perform until receiving a status message.
    After a failed attempt, the wait time for the next attempt will be double.

``CONFIG_MIN_SESSION_CONNECTION_INTERVAL=<number>``
    This value represents how long it will take to send a new ``create_session`` or ``delete_session`` if the first sent has not answered.
    The wait time for each attempt will be double until reach ``CONFIG_MAX_SESSION_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS``.
    It is measured in milliseconds.

``CONFIG_MIN_HEARTBEAT_TIME_INTERVAL=<number>``
    Into a reliable communication, this value represents how long it will take the first heartbeat to be sent.
    The wait time for the next heartbeat will be double.
    It is measured in milliseconds.

``CONFIG_BIG_ENDIANNESS=<bool>``
    This value must correspond to the memory endianness of the device in which the *Client* is running.
    `FALSE` implies that the machine is little-endian and `TRUE` implies big-endian.

``CONFIG_UDP_TRANSPORT_MTU=<number>``
    This value corresponds to the `Maximum Transmission Unit` able to send and receive by UDP.
    Internally a buffer is created with this size.

``CONFIG_TCP_TRANSPORT_MTU=<number>``
    This value corresponds to the `Maximum Transmission Unit` able to send and receive by TCP.
    Internally a buffer is created with this size.

``CONFIG_SERIAL_TRANSPORT_MTU=<number>``
    This value corresponds to the `Maximum Transmission Unit` able to send and receive by Serial.
    Internally a buffer is created proportional to this size.

Streams
-------
The client communication is performed by streams.
The streams can be seen as communication channels.
There are two types of streams: best-effort and reliable streams and you can create several of them.

* Best-effort streams will send and receive the data leaving the reliability to the transport layer.
  As a result, the best effort streams consume fewer resources than a reliable stream.
  Also, the message size sent or received by a best-effort stream must be less or equal than the *MTU* defined in the transport used.

* Reliable streams perform the communication without lost regardless of the transport layer
  and allow message fragmentation to send and receive messages longer than the *MTU*.

  To avoid a loss of data, the reliable streams use additional messages to confirm the delivery, along with a history of the messages sent and received.
  The history is used to store messages that can not be currently processed because of several reasons such as:
  delivery order, incomplete fragments or messages that can not be confirmed yet.
  If the history is full:

  * The messages that will be written to the agent will be discarded until the history get space to store them.
    So, the user must wait to write in those streams (they can be considered blocked).

  * The messages received from the agent will be discarded.
    The library will try to recover the discarded messages requesting them to the agent (increasing the bandwidth consumption in that process).

  For that, a low history causes more messages to be discarded, increasing the data traffic because they need to be sent again.
  A long history will reduce the data traffic of confirmation messages in transports with a high loss rate.
  This internal management of the communication implies that a reliable stream is more expensive than best-effort streams,
  in both, memory and bandwidth, but it is possible to play with these values using the history size.

The streams are maybe the highest memory load part of the application.
For that, the choice of a right configuration for the application purpose is highly recommendable, especially when the target is a limited resource device.
The :ref:`optimization_label` page explains more about how to archive this.

API
---
As a nomenclature, *eProsima Micro XRCE-DDS Client* API uses a ``uxr_`` prefix in all of their public API functions and ``uxr`` prefix in the types.
In constants values, an ``UXR_`` prefix is used.
The functions belonging to the public interface of the library are only those with the tag ``UXRDDLAPI`` in their declarations.

------

Create entities common profile
``````````````````````````````
These functions are enabled when ``PROFILE_CREATE_ENTITIES_XML`` or ``PROFILE_CREATE_ENTITIES_REF`` are selected in the ``client.config`` file.
The declaration of these functions can be found in ``uxr/client/profile/session/common_create_entities.h``.

------

.. code-block:: c

    uint16_t uxr_buffer_delete_entity(uxrSession* session, uxrStreamId stream_id, uxrObjectId object_id);

Removes an entity.
The message is only written into the stream buffer.
To send the message is necessary call to ``uxr_flash_output_streams`` or to ``uxr_run_session`` function.

:session: Session structure previously initialized.
:stream_id: The output stream ID where the message will be written.
:object_id: The identifier of the object which will be deleted.

------

Read access profile
```````````````````
These functions are enabled when ``PROFILE_READ_ACCESS`` is selected in the ``client.config`` file.
The declaration of these functions can be found in ``uxr/client/profile/session/read_access.h``.

------

.. code-block:: c

    uint16_t uxr_buffer_request_data(uxrSession* session, uxrStreamId stream_id, uxrObjectId datareader_id, uxrStreamId data_stream_id, uxrDeliveryControl* delivery_control);

This function requests a read from a `datareader` of the *Agent*.
The returned value is an identifier of the request.
All received topic will have the same request identifier.
The topics will be received at the callback topic through the ``run_session`` function.
If there is no error with the request data, the topics will be received generating a status callback with the value ``UXR_STATUS_OK``.
If there is an error, a status error will be sent by the *Agent*.
The message is only written into the stream buffer.
To send the message is necessary call to ``uxr_flash_output_streams`` or to ``uxr_run_session`` function.

:session: Session structure previously initialized.
:stream_id: The output stream ID where the message will be written.
:object_id: The `datareader` ID that will read the topic from the DDS World.
:data_stream_id: The input stream ID where the data will be received.
:delivery_control: Optional information about how the delivery must be.
                   A ``NULL`` value is accepted, in this case, only one topic will be received.

------

Write access profile
````````````````````

This function will initialize an ``ucdrBuffer`` struct where a topic of ``topic_size`` size must be serialized.
Whether the necessary gap for writing a ``topic_size`` bytes into the stream, the returned value is ``true``, otherwise ``false``.
The topic will be sent in the next ``run_session`` function.

NOTE: All ``topic_size`` bytes requested will be sent to the *Agent* after a ``run_session`` call, no matter if the ``ucdrBuffer`` has been used or not.

:session: Session structure previously initialized.
:stream_id: The output stream ID where the message will be written.
:datawriter_id: The `datawriter` ID that will write the topic to the DDS World.

Discovery profile
```````````````````
The discovery profile allows discovering *Agents* in the network by UDP.
The reachable *Agents* will respond to the discovery call sending information about them, as their IP and port.

                The current *Agent* will be selected as *chosen*.
                A `false` implies that the discovery routine must continue searching *Agents*.
:args: User arguments passed to the callback function.
:chosen: If the callback function was returned `true`, this value will contain the *Agent* value of the callback.
