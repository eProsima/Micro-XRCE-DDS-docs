Deployment example
==================

This part will show how to deploy a system using *Micro XRCE-DDS* in a real enviroment.
An example of this can be found into ``examples/Deployment`` folder.

Previous tutorials are based in `all in one` examples, that is, examples that create entities, publish or subscribe and then delete the resources.
One possible real purpose of this, consists in differentiate the logic of `creating entities` and the actions of `publishing and subscribing`.
This can be done creating two differents clients.
One for configurating the entities in the agent, and run possibly once, only for creating the entities at configuration time.
And other/s, that logs in the same session as the configure client (sharing the entities) and only publishes or subscribes data.

This way allows to create easy clients in production only with the purpose of send and receive data.
Related to it, exists the concept of `profile` that allows to build the client library only with the behavior chosen (only publish or only subscribe, for example).
See :ref:`micro_xrce_dds_client_label` for more information about this.

Next diagram shows an example about how to configure the enviroment using a `configurator client`.

Initial state
-------------

The enviroment contains two agents (is perfectly possible to use only one agent too), and two clients, one for publishing and other subscribing.


Configurate the publisher
-------------------------

    .. image:: images/deployment_1.svg
        :width: 600 px
        :align: center

In this state a `configurator client` is connected to the agent `A` with the `client key` that will be used by the future `publisher client` (0xAABBCCDD).
Once a session is logged in, the `configurator client` creates all necesary entities for the `publisher client`.
This implies the creation of `participant`, `topic`, `publisher`, and `datawriter` entities.
These entities have a representation as DDS entities, and can be reached now from the DDS world.
That implies that a possible `subscriber DDS entity` could be already listening topics if it match with a `publisher DDS entity` through `DDS` world.

Publish
-------
    .. image:: images/deployment_2.svg
        :width: 600 px
        :align: center

Then, the `publisher client` is connected to the agent `A`.
This client logs in session with its client key (0xAABBCCDD).
At that moment, it can use all entities created related to this `client key`.
Because all entities that it uses were created successful by the `configurator client`, the `publisher client` can inmediately publish to `DDS`.


Configurate the subscriber
--------------------------

    .. image:: images/deployment_3.svg
        :width: 600 px
        :align: center

Again, the `configurator client` connects and logs in, this time to agent `B`, now with the subscriber's key (0x11223344).
In this case, the entities that the `configurator client` creates are a `participant`, a `topic`, a `subscriber`, and a `datareader`.
The entities created by the `configuraton client` will be available until the session is deleted.

Subscriber
----------

    .. image:: images/deployment_4.svg
        :width: 600 px
        :align: center

Once the subscriber is configured, the `subscriber client` logs in the agent `B`.
As all their entities have been created previously, so it only need to configure the read after log in.
Once the data request message has been sent, the subscriber will receive the topics from the publisher through `DDS` world.
