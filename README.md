*eProsima Micro XRCE-DDS* is a software solution which allows to communicate eXtremely Resource Constrained Environments (XRCEs) with an existing DDS network.
This implementation complies with the specification of the [eXtremely Resource Constrained Environments DDS (DDS-XRCE)](https://www.omg.org/spec/DDS-XRCE/) protocol as defined and maintained by the Object Management Group (OMG) consortium.

The *Micro XRCE-DDS* library implements a client-server protocol that enables resource-constrained devices (clients) to take part in DDS communications.
The *Micro XRCE-DDS Agent* (server) acts as a bridge to make this communication possible.
The *Micro XRCE-DDS Agent* acts on behalf of the *Micro XRCE-DDS Clients* and enables them to take part to the DDS Global Data Space
as DDS publishers and/or subscribers.

*Micro XRCE-DDS* provides both a plug and play *Micro XRCE-DDS Agent* and an API layer which allows the user to implement the *Micro XRCE-DDS Clients*.
